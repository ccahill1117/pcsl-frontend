<div><h3><a id="one"></a>1. LEAGUE OVERVIEW AND FORMAT<a @click="scrollMeTo('top')" title="top"><img src="graphics/icon_up_triangle.gif" class="navicon"></a></h3></div>
<p><strong>1.1</strong> Portland City Squash League is an informal, volunteer supported organization of Squash Racquets enthusiasts. Most participants are members of athletic clubs in Portland, OR, USA.</p>

<p><strong>1.2</strong> All players must be in good standing with the League and affiliated clubs in order to participate in league activities.</p>

<p><strong>1.3</strong> A new player may be contacted to play an evaluation match to establish correct ranking.</p>

<p><strong>1.4</strong> Eye protection is required. Any player refusing to wear eye protection will default the match.</p>

<p><strong>1.5</strong> There are three League seasons per year: <strong>Winter</strong>, running from late January through early May, <strong>Summer</strong>, running from June through mid-August and <strong>Fall</strong>, running from late September through mid-December. League membership is seasonal. Before each season begins, participants pay a fee to the League for that season. Play takes place at several participating clubs in the Portland area and Reed College which make their courts available free of charge at specific times on Wednesday evenings when a season is underway. Fees go towards Internet services, season end parties, prizes and occasional support for other local squash events.</p>

<h3>FALL & WINTER LEAGUES</h3>
<p><strong>1.6</strong> Players compete against one another in five person teams organized by rank within two Divisions: 1 and 2. Division 1 comprises higher ranked players, Division 2 lower ranked and beginning players. The first week of Fall and Winter league seasons is in 'round robin' format. Players in a team meet at the club posted in the season schedule to get to know one another, play and establish whether their position within the team is correct. Under the supervision of the team captain, players can agree to change places with other members of their team. If the change is not agreed by both parties and sanctioned by the team captain, the two team members arrange to play one another in a formal, best of 5, challenge match. A challenge match may take place at any time other than when League match play is scheduled and underway and as described below.</p>
<p><strong>1.7</strong> Players in each team will be ranked according to standard with the highest standard player playing in the number one position.  Initial rankings are provided in the team rosters which are based on the draft.  During the league, players may challenge the next higher ranked player on their team for their position.  Any player so challenged must accept to play the challenge match in a reasonable period of time (typically within a two week period).  No player shall play more than 1 challenge match per week.  The players of challenge matches should respect club guest policies and pay any required guest fees.</p>
<p><strong>1.8</strong> Each team will play every other team during the league period.  All matches will be played according to standard international rules. Team rosters and the schedule of their respective playing times and locations are posted to the League website at <a @click="scrollMeTo('ortlandsquash.org')" target="_blank">portlandsquash.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1.9</strong> Whenever possible, there should be a referee/marker for matches.  All league participants are expected to referee on a regular basis.</p>

<h3>SUMMER LEAGUE</h3>
<p><strong>1.10</strong> Summer League follows a recreational rather than competitive format. To allow for other commitments and activities that members may have scheduled for the summer months, players are grouped by skill level and play in 'round robin' format at a different participating club each week. Group rosters and the schedule of their respective playing times and locations are posted to the League website at <a>portlandsquash.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1.11</strong> PLAY: Players enter their names on a signup board or roster sheet while off court. When a court becomes available, two opponents play a single game to <a @click="scrollMeTo('par11')">PAR 11</a>. Winner stays on for a second game against the next opponent who replaces the losing player, NO EXCEPTIONS.</p>

<div><h3><a id="two"></a>2. SCORING<a @click="scrollMeTo('top')" title="top"><img src="graphics/icon_up_triangle.gif" class="navicon"></a></h3></div>

<p><strong>2.1</strong> In <strong>Fall</strong> and <strong>Winter</strong> leagues, teams earn points as follows:</p>
<p>1 point for each match won.  All matches count for points.</p>
<p>1 bonus point for the team that wins the most matches. If the match scores are tied, the bonus goes to the team that has won the most games. If the game scores are tied, each team receives 1/2 bonus point.</p>
<p>1 bonus point for each team that has a full team turnout. Full team turnout means that all players are available to play at the scheduled time and place, or have rescheduled and played their match early.</p>
<p>Matches won by default (as in the case of a "No-Show" by one player) will be considered a 3-0 game win.</p>
<p>Examples of scoring (with both teams having full team turnout):</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th colspan="2">Match Score</th>
<td rowspan="5">&nbsp;</td>
<th colspan="2">Points</th>

</table>
<p><strong>2.2</strong> The team with the most points at the end of the season will win their division. If two teams have equal points, the result of the match played between the teams during the league season will determine the result. If the two teams tie their match or if more than two teams have equal points, the team with the most games won over the full season will win.</p>

<p><strong>2.3</strong> Match ties: Occasionally a match tie due to no shows on both teams can occur. See Para. 3.5.6 below. In the event of a tie between the number of matches won by the two opposing teams, the winning team point goes to the team with the higher game total. Example: Team A Position 1 does not show. Team B Position 1 does not show. In the remaining four positions, Teams A and B both win two matches each. Team A wins a total of 10 games, Team B wins a total of 8 games. Team A takes the overall match win point.</p>
<div><h3><a id="par11"></a>'PAR 11' Scoring<a @click="scrollMeTo('top')" title="top"><img src="graphics/icon_up_triangle.gif" class="navicon"></a></h3></div>

<p><strong>2.4</strong> In response to the WSF vote during the World Squash Federation Annual General Meeting held in Manchester, England mid-October 2008, the official rules of squash were changed to make "point-a-rally" (or "PAR") scoring to 11 points the primary scoring system of the softball singles game. The "hand-in / hand-out" (or "international" scoring to 9 points will become a secondary scoring option for the sport.</p>

<p><strong>2.5</strong> All U.S. SQUASH sanctioned play is by default scored PAR 11, which requires a player to win 11 points, or if tied at 10-all, to win by two. All U.S. Championships, junior and adult, beginning with the U.S. Junior Open held December 20-23, 2008, will use PAR 11 scoring.</p>

<p><strong>2.6</strong> Portland City Squash League has adopted PAR 11 scoring as of the Winter 2009 League season. On mutual agreement between two competing players and <i>provided that no waiting player objects*</i>, opponents may opt to score per the traditional hand-in / hand-out method to 9 points OR, as of January 1, 2010, to PAR15. Scoring for PAR15 is as for PAR11 but up to 15 points instead of 11. Whichever method is used, the result will be recognized for League match tally purposes.</p>
<p>*Where a waiting player objects mid-game, match contestants shall complete the game using the scoring method in force at the start of the game. Remaining games for that match shall be played using PAR11.</p>
<p><strong>2.7</strong> Scoring for <strong>Summer</strong> league is PAR 11 (unless otherwise agreed, see Para. 2.5 above) between individual opponents within their assigned group. No scores are recorded and there is no competition between groups.</p>

<div><h3><a id="three"></a>3. EARLY / LATE SCHEDULING OF MATCHES AND SUBSTITUTIONS<a @click="scrollMeTo('top')" title="top"><img src="graphics/icon_up_triangle.gif" class="navicon"></a></h3></div>
<p><strong>3.1</strong> All participants in the league are expected to participate on a regular basis at the scheduled time and location.  If exceptional circumstances create a scheduling or availability problem for a player, the following procedures may be followed:</p>
<p><strong>3.2</strong> Rescheduling of matches:</p>
<p><strong>3.2.1</strong> Matches may be played <strong>in advance</strong> of the scheduled match date by mutual agreement of the two players involved. The results of such matches must be reported to the team captains immediately after play. For scoring purposes, the match will count towards the "full team turnout bonus". If an earlier match time cannot be agreed upon, then the match should be played at the scheduled time.</p>
<!-- gotta use refs -->
<p ref="3_2_2"><strong>3.2.2</strong> Players must <strong>pay all appropriate club guest fees</strong> for rescheduled matches at a club where they are not a member. As a matter of courtesy, the player requesting that a match be rescheduled should pay the required guest fees. If possible, matches should be rescheduled at off peak times to minimize court pressure at the clubs. See also <a @click="scrollMeTo('eight')">CLUB ETIQUETTE & PROTOCOLS</a>. Clubs may require a player to show photo ID.</p>
<p><strong><a ref="3_2_3">3.2.3</a></strong> Schedule matches <strong>may not be played after the scheduled date of play</strong>. If such a match is played, then the match will not count for scoring purposes, and both teams will lose their "full team turnout bonus".</p>
<p><strong>3.3</strong> Substitutions:</p>
<p><strong>3.3.1</strong> If a player cannot arrange to play the match early, that player must find a substitute of similar standard, arrange for the substitute to play at the scheduled time and location, and inform the captain of the substitution. All substitutions arranged in this way will count towards the "full team turnout bonus".</p>
<p><strong>3.3.2</strong> A substitute must be of approximately the same or lower standard than the player to be replaced if the match is to count for scoring purposes.  If the substitute is of a higher standard, then the match is a default and the match point will be awarded against the substitute.  Whatever the relative standard of the substitute, the match will always count towards the "full team turnout bonus".</p>
<p><strong>3.3.3</strong> A list of reserves will be provided to all squash league participants and will include the standard of each player.  Players in teams that have a bye are allowed to play as substitutes for other teams on the week of the bye.  If a substitute is not listed on the reserve list or is not selected from a team with a bye, the committee must be contacted to determine whether the player is of a similar standard or not.</p>
<p><strong>3.3.4</strong> A player on a team may not play as a substitute except during a week that the player's  team has a bye.</p>
<p><strong>3.3.5</strong> Substitutes may not play more than one match during any single week.</p>
<p><strong>3.4</strong> Players that do not play at the scheduled time, and do not play their matches in advance or arrange a substitute will be considered a "No-Show". The committee reserves the right to drop a player from the league, arrange for a replacement, or not allow participation in the next league if that player has more than one "No-Show" during the season.</p>
<p><strong>3.5</strong> 15 Minute Default: Matches are to begin at the scheduled time or immediately after the preceding match. If a court is available to City League and there are no other matches and a match does not begin within 15 minutes of the scheduled time or within 15 minutes of the ending of the preceding match then a default occurs.</p>
<p><strong>3.5.1</strong> If a player from team A is dressed and ready to play and the player from team B is not on the court ready to play within 15 minutes of the scheduled time or within 15 minutes of the ending of the preceding match then the player from team B defaults the match, game score is recorded as 3-0 in favor of team A and team B loses the full team turnout point.</p>
<p><strong>3.5.2</strong> If there is not a player from both team A and team B dressed and ready to play within 15 minutes of the scheduled time or within 15 minutes of the ending of the preceding match then both players default, the score is recorded as 0-0, and both teams lose the full team turnout point.</p>
<p><strong>3.5.3</strong> The defaults can be simultaneous, i.e. if there is more than one match that can not begin.</p>
<p>Team A has level 6, 8, and 9 players present, Team B has level 6 and 9 players present at the scheduled time and there are three courts available for city league play. The level 6 match and level 9 matches begin, Team B's level 7 player comes to courts ready to play at the 10 minute point, Team A's level 7 player comes to court at the 20 minute point. At the 15 minute point Team A defaults its level 7 and level 10 match and loses full team turnout. Team B defaults it's level 8 and level 10 match and loses full team turnout.</p>
<p><strong>3.5.4</strong> A defaulted match may be played and the points recorded under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both players agree to play the match and</li>
<li>Both captains agree to have the match played and</li>
<li>The match is played that night following the last match scheduled at that club, including the full schedule of the other section.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3.5.5</strong> Any dispute in the 15 minute default shall be submitted to the <a href="mailto:membership@portlandsquash.org&subject=City League Rules Adjudication Request">League Commitee</a> prior to Friday at 5:00 PM of the week of the default. Their decision is final. In the event a dispute includes a committee member, that member will be excluded from the decision making.</p>

<p><strong>3.5.6</strong> No shows resulting in tied scores: Both teams winning the same number of matches in a given week's play and both teams having a no show can result in a forfeit of the full team turnout point for both teams and a match tie. Scoring is recorded per Para. 2.3 above.</p>

<div><h3><a id="four"></a>4. REPORTING OF MATCH RESULTS<a @click="scrollMeTo('top')" title="top"><img src="graphics/icon_up_triangle.gif" class="navicon"></a></h3></div>

<p><strong><a ref="4_1">4.1</a></strong> Within <strong>72 hours</strong> of the completion of the week's matches, the winning team captain must submit the match scores via the League website <a href='login_scores.php'>scores entry page</a>. If a team captain is unavailable to report scores, it is the captain's responsibility to delegate reporting to another team member. Scores from the final week of FAll or Winter season play must be submitted at the season ending party.</p>

<div><h3><a id="five"></a>5. GENERAL CONDUCT<a @click="scrollMeTo('top')" title="top"><img src="graphics/icon_up_triangle.gif" class="navicon"></a></h3></div>

<p><strong>5.1</strong> City league participants are strongly encouraged to play with appropriate "Squash Etiquette". This includes sportsmanship on the court and an ongoing concern for your opponent's and your own safety throughout the game. Do not argue with the referee. Call your own doubtful shots down and respect club property. Play your best and win through the quality of your game.</p>

<h3><a id="interference"></a>The Interference Line of Thinking</h3>
<div>Refereeing can be a thankless if necessary task. It always helps to know the rules and to use the correct calls, but the real 'nitty-gritty' is what you do when one of the players appeals for a let. Below is a summary of the thought process a referee should go through when asked 'Let Please'...</div>
 <ul class="interference">
  <li>Did interference occur ? The striker has four basic rights, and interference has occurred if the opponent fails to provide him with any of these, even if he has made every effort to do so:</li>
<li>Unobstructed direct access to the ball</li>
<li>A fair view of the ball</li>
<li>Freedom to hit the ball</li>
<li>Freedom to play the ball directly to the front wall</li>
</ul>

<p>If no interference has occurred, then the call is NO LET, otherwise move on to no. 2.</p>

<ul class="interference">
<li>Could the obstructed player have reached the ball and made a good return? And was he making every effort to do so? If either answer is NO, then it's NO LET, otherwise move on to no. 3</li>
<li>Did the obstructing player make every effort avoid the interference? If he didn't, then it's a STROKE, otherwise move on to no. 4</li>
<li>Was the obstructed player in a position to play a winning return ? If so, then it's a STROKE, otherwise it's just a LET.</li>
</ul>

<div><h3><a id="six"></a>6. WINNERS<a @click="scrollMeTo('top')" title="top"><img src="graphics/icon_up_triangle.gif" class="navicon"></a></h3></div>

<p><strong>6.1</strong> Prizes of squash equipment will be awarded to the first, second and third place teams in each division.</p>

<div><h3><a id="seven"></a>7. CAPTAINS & GROUP LEADERS<a @click="scrollMeTo('top')" title="top"><img src="graphics/icon_up_triangle.gif" class="navicon"></a></h3></div>
<p><strong>7.1</strong> In <strong>Fall</strong> and <strong>Winter</strong> leagues each team is managed by a captain. A captain's responsibilities include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Picking the team members from a pool of registrants before the league season begins</li>
<li>Updating and passing League scheduling and rule change information on to team members</li>
<li>Encouraging and enabling maximum participation to minimize 'no shows'</li>
<li>Assisting with the selection of and contact with substitute players</li>
<li>Recording and submitting scores via the online system</li>
<li>Demonstrating and promoting etiquette and adherence to the rules of the game</li>
<li>Arranging for ad hoc refereeing of league matches</li>
<li>Liasing and promoting good relations with and respectful use of participating clubs</li>
<li>Communicating with the League Committee to obtain guidance and adjudication on scoring and disputes</li>
<li>Promoting and enforcing (where necessary) safe and respectful conduct on court for the benefit of all</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>Summer</strong> league each group is managed by a group leader. Responsibilities are essentially the same as a captain's, except that there are no teams to pick or scores to submit.</p>
